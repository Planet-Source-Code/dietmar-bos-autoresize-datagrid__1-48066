## AutoResize DataGrid


</div>

### Description

The Code auto-resizes all columns of a DataGrid.

The longest string of a gridcolumn is the new width of the column. Similar to this ListView- or FlexGrid- feature.

I havn't found anything similar here, so I just want to put it in the codebase.
 
### More Info
 
2 parameters:

a) pointer to the datagrid

b) pointer to any form

most tabular controls in VB have a functionality that aligns colums of those table to a 'rational' width, that makes good use of the visible space. Not so with the DataGrid control, which is a fine piece of software in all other regards. To fill this gap, this code here was written.

none that I know of
